/*
Rohan is an automobile insurance agent who helps clients
determine car insurance premiums based on various factors
such as the car's price, age, and engine capacity. He needs a
program that calculates both.
. Third-Party Premium (TPP): based solely on engine
capacity, and
· Comprehensive Premium: based on car price, age,
depreciation, Own Damage Premium (ODP), Insurance
Cover Discount (ICD), and No Claim Bonus (NCB).
Help Rohan develop a program that reads the required car
details, computes all the necessary values, and prints a
detailed premium breakdown.
Create a class named Carinsurance with the following
attributes:

· price (int): Price of the car in rupees
- age (int): Age of the car in years
· capacity (int): Engine capacity in cc
· location (string): Location of registration

Methods
1.calculateThirdPartyPremium()

Calculates TPP based on engine capacity:
. If capacity < 1000: TPP = 2182
. If 1000 <= capacity ≤ 1500: TPP =3383
. If capacity > 1500: TPP = 7890

2. calculateComprehensivePremium()
Depreciation Coefficient (dc) based on age:
· for age 1 => depreciation percentage = 20%
· for age 2 =› depreciation percentage = 30%
· for age 3 => depreciation percentage = 40%
· for age 4 => depreciation percentage = 50%
· for age greater than or equal to 5 => depreciation
percentage = 0%
Calculating the Insured Declared Value (IDV) of the car by
reducing the original price based on the depreciation
coefficient (dc).

IDV = price - (dc * price)

Calculate Own Damage Premium (ODP) based on percent:
· if age is less than or equal to 3 => percent =3.127%
· if age is greater than 3 => percent =3.283%
1. ODP = percent * IDV
2. Insurance Cover Discount (ICD) = 50% of ODP
3. No Claim Bonus (NCB) = 25% of ICD
4. Personal Accident Cover (PAC) = ₴100
5. Comprehensive Premium = NCB + PAC

input

The input consists of the price(int), age(int), capacity(int), and
location(string), separated by a space.


Output format :

The output prints the details in the first line, separated by a
space.

The second line prints the Third-Party Premium (tpp), which is
determined based on the engine capacity.

The third line prints the Insured Declared Value (idv), calculated
by considering depreciation based on the car's age.

The fourth line prints the Own Damage Premium (odp),
calculated as a percentage of the IDV.

The fifth line prints the Insurance Cover Discount (icd), which is
50% of ODP.

The sixth line prints the No Claim Bonus (ncb), which is 25% of
ICD.

The seventh and final line prints the Final Comprehensive
Premium, calculated as the sum of NCB and a fixed Personal
Accident Cover (pac =100).
[Note: The final results for TPP,IDV, ODP, ICD, NCB, and
Comprehensive Premium should be printed as integers without
decimal points.]
